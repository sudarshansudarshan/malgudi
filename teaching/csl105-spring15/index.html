<h1>Course Overview</h1>



<p>
</p><h3>Description</h3>
<p></p>

<p>
This is a pre-requisite course for almost all topics of computer science
 that you will study in the forthcoming semester. The word discrete in 
discrete mathematics has dual meaning: one being an antonym of the word 
continuous, which signifies, we are going to deal with the number line 
comprising of integers. The second being a discrete bunch of 
pre-requisite topics for computer science, stitched together and offered
 as a subject. Most of the topics that will be covered in the course do 
not assume any pre-requisites and our discussions will resemble puzzle 
solving sessions. The subject is very fascinating and it has been my 
observation that many graduating students regard this as one of their 
favourite subjects. Apart from aiding as a pre-requisite to other 
courses, discrete mathematics helps in heightening the mathematical 
aptitude of a student. If you ever enjoyed puzzle solving, you will like
 the ride through this subject. The treatment of the subject is 
excellent in the prescribed text book (mentioned below). The text book 
gets to the level of a college fresher without assuming any preliminary 
knowledge. The motivation of concepts is through several worked examples
 which makes learning easy and fun. The textbook has a historical 
account that appears at the end of every chapter, which I recommend you 
all to read without fail. There are several nice books and popular 
science articles on this subject which I can pass on to you people if 
you are interested. You are encouraged to read up extra material and 
discuss the same with the course instructor and TA beyond the class and 
office hours. We sincerely hope that you enjoy this course at its 
fullest.

 </p>

<p>
</p><h3>Textbook</h3>
<p></p>

<p>
The textbook for the course is <em> Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics, 5th Ediction </em>
 by Ralph P. Grimaldi. We will cover the first 13 chapters from this 
text book. This book is available on flipkart and amazon. I personally 
liked the e-version of the book which is available for a nominal price 
on amazon (click <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Combinatorial-Mathematics-Pearson-International-ebook/dp/B00IZ0L3XU/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=">here</a>).
 This e-version opens on your desktop/tablet. I strongly suggest that 
you buy an e-version instead of a hardcopy as it helps you annotate the 
text and search through the text easily. There is a third version of 
this book available as a pdf document online (if you google), although I
 am not sure if this is legal or pirated version.
</p>

<h3>Syllabus</h3>
<p>
The syllabus for the course will be the first 13 chapters from the above
 book which will make 90% of the syllabus. The rest 10% will be a bunch 
of miscellaneous topics, covered at the end of the course. We will 
provide you with references for these topics, as and when they are 
covered.

</p>


<h1>Grading</h1>

<p>

The course comprises of 3 lecture hours and 1 tutorial hour. Grading 
will be based on : weekly problem sets (15%), surprise quiz (20%), 
Activity (10%), minor(20%), major(30%),attendance (5%).

</p>




<h3>Grading Criteria</h3>
<p>The grading will be absolute, based on the following criteria</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tbody><tr><td>[85,100]</td><td>A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[80,85)</td><td>A-</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[75,80)</td><td>B</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[70-75)</td><td>B-</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[65-70)</td><td>C</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[60-65)</td><td>C-</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[50-60)</td><td>D</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[0-50)</td><td>F</td></tr>
    
</tbody></table>


<h3>Distribution of Marks</h3>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tbody><tr><td>Problem Sets</td><td>15%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Surprise Quizzes</td><td>20%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Activity</td><td>10%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Attendance</td><td>05%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Minor</td><td>20%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Major</td><td>30%</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<h3>Problem Sets</h3>

<p>You are requested to note the following:</p>

<ul>

  
 <li>You must work <b>alone</b> on problem sets. You are <b>not allowed</b>
 to collaborate or discuss with anyone (including the course instructor 
and TA). The questions that will be posed to you will be self contained 
or will be a direct exercise problem from the text book. </li>
     <li>You should <b>not google</b> for a solution. The only companion
 to you during your solving of the given assignment will be the course 
text book, we suggest that you don't stay online when you are solving 
the exercise problems.</li>
     <li>Just in case we observe that you are copying from the internet (even partially) or collaborating with someone, you will get a <b>straight F grade</b>. </li>
         <li>You are not allowed to show your assignments to anyone, 
even if your friend sees your written script or discusses and borrows 
ideas from you and tries using the same method, we will regard that as <b>plagiarism</b>
 (straight F grade to both of you!). Even soliciting help for 
assignments is against the honor code, in case someone requests you, 
please report the name of that student to us and we will keep your 
identity anonymous and initiate action against him/her.</li>
     
<li> Problem sets will be posted every week and you will be given sufficient time to solve it. Submissions are accepted in <b>written format</b> only, on an A4 sized sheet which should be <u>punched and tagged and not pinned</u>. </li>
    <li>You must submit your assignment in the class sharpt at 0955 hrs every Monday. Late submissions of assignment will <b>fetch a 0</b>.
 In case you are unable to attempt a question, you should describe in 
detail your partial analysis /understanding/approach which, if observed 
to be good, can at times fetch you full marks. Take note that you are 
not allowed to submit your assignment before or after the above 
specified time, you may however submit it through a friend, just in case
 you are absent.
</li>
<li> The total number of problem sets isn't preset. We will normalize 
your marks and this will carry 15% of the overall course weightage.
    

</li><li> Minor and Major question paper should be considered as two 
additional problem sets and must be submitted before the deadline, which
 will be announced immediately after your exams. </li>

</ul>


<h3>Surprise Quiz</h3>

We will have a few surprise quiz sessions to test your understanding of 
the concepts taught in the previous classes. If you are attentive in the
 class, make notes and read them once before the class, you will do very
 well and will most certainly secure full marks. The number of quizzes 
isn't pre-decided, your marks will be normalized and will comprise of 
20% of the course weightage.

<h3>Activity</h3>
Activity will comprise of two parts:

<ul>

<li> Written assignment that is due by the first week of March.</li>
<li> Two Collaborating Learning Activities, one in the last week of January and the other one in the first week of March. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Attendance</h3>

Attendance for the course is compulsory. If you secure less than 75% 
attendance, you will be given an F grade, which is as per the institute 
rule. Attendance carries 0-5 marks, details of which is given in the 
table below:


<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tbody><tr><td>[95,100]</td><td>5</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[90,95)</td><td>4</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[85,90)</td><td>3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[80,85)</td><td>2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[75,80)</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[0,75)</td><td>F</td></tr>
    
</tbody></table>

I assume you all have undergone a course in real analysis and know what one means by a closed[]  and open interval() :-)

<h3>Minor and Major</h3>

<p>There will be two exams in the course, minor and major. The portions for major exam will be the entire syllabus.</p>

Minor will be of 2 hours duration and will comprise of 5 questions with 
three degrees of difficulty:  easy (1 quesiton), medium (2 questions) 
and hard (2 questions). Major will be of 3 hours duration and will 
comprise of 6 questions with three degrees of difficulty:  easy (2 
quesitons), medium (2 questions) and hard (2 questions). Degree of 
difficulty is a very subjective term which is left to the instructor to 
decide.

A student who has consistently practiced solving exercise problems from 
the text book and has solved all problem sets should be able to solve 
all the quesitons easily.




<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p> We are overly and overtly serious when it comes to academic 
integrity. We have 0 tolerance towards students who cheat. Action 
against those who cheat will involve not less than assigning them an F 
grade followed by immediate expulsion from the course. Over and above 
this, the case will be reported to the disciplinary committee which may 
decide to suspend the student for a semester or two. To repeat, <u>you 
must work alone on homework problems and not discuss them with anyone. 
The only materials you can refer when working on your problem sets are 
your course notes and the assigned text book. You may not refer to 
online sources or talk to others. When you are in doubt, ask the 
instructor or TA what is allowed and what isn't. Just in case you have 
overseen/suspect someone copying in the quiz/exam/problemsets, dutifully
 report it to us, we will scrutinize their scripts and will initiate 
action against them if they are found guilty. We assure that your 
identity wll be kept anonymous. We request that you report immediately 
(even if you are partially suspicious of any such malpractice amongst 
your classmates.)</u></p>

<p><b>Class 3</b> (Saturday, 10th Jan 2015, 0900-0950)</p>
<p>We starte with the question of finding the cardinality of the power 
set of a set with n elements. We came out with many ways of showing that
 the answer is 2^n. We then saw different interpretations of nC2, many 
of you came out with nearly 10 different questions for which nC2 is the 
answer :-) </p>
<p><u>Textbook chapters:</u> None

</p><hr>
<p><b>Class 4</b> (Saturday, 10th Jan 2015, 1000-1050)</p>
<p>We solved a graph degree problem using pigeon hole principle. We 
observed that a sequence of length 10 has a monotone subsequence of 
length 4. We constructed a table and saw that the proof follows from 
Pigeon Hole Principle. We then stated the general result "Given any 
sequence of length (n^2)+1 there is always a monotone subsequence of 
length n+1"</p>

</p><hr>
<p><b>Class 5</b> (Saturday, 10th Jan 2015, 1100-1150)</p>
<p>We stated and tried solving the Catalan Number sequence. We noted 
that the number of ways to reach (5,5) from (0,0) without tresspassing 
the diagonal is a non-trivial question. We solved this using a simple 
bijection trick</p>
<p><u>Textbook chapters:</u> 1.6

</p><hr>
<p><b>Class 6</b> (Saturday, 10th Jan 2015, 1200-1250)</p>

this isn't part of the text book, but is an interesting concept that you
 all should know. We discussed the binomial theorem and spoke a bit 
about pascal's triangle, followed by a combinatorial problem based on 
the pascal's triangle. We briefly discussed the rule of sums and the 
rule of products. We ended our class by posing the question: "In how 
many ways can the entire class have 5 different flavours of ice-cream."</p>

how the formula works. We defined a few standard terminologies in Graphs
 and discussed the Konigsberg bridge problem and stated the theorem  "A 
connected graph has an Eularian Circuit iff all the vertices are of even
 degree"."</p>

</p><hr>
<p><b>Class 10</b> (Wednesday 14th Jan 2015, 1145-1235)</p>

 it. We then applied induction to solve the theorem. We ended our class 
by posing a question on graph isomorphism. </p>
