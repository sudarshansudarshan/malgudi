<h1>Course Overview</h1>


<p>
</p><h3>Description</h3>
<p></p>

<p>

This is a dual level course for 3rd/4th year B.Tech CSE students and is an advanced course assuming Data structures and Discrete Mathematics as pre-requisites.

You may consider talking to the following students who have credit this course, to get more details:
<br><br>

<li>Introduction to Social networks</li>

</ul>

The course will be divided into 4 quarters:


<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tbody>
<tr><td><b><center><br>First Quarter</b> <br>(The Motivation) </center>  </td><td>The first quarter will comprise of reading of a couple<br> of popular science books in this subject followed by <br>a few talks. We will cover the basics of Network science.</td></tr>

<h1>Grading</h1>

<p>

The course comprises of 3 lecture hours and 2 hours of lab. Grading 
will be based on : weekly programming assignments (25%), surprise quiz (15%), 
three activites (30%), minor(10%), major(15%),attendance (5%).

</p>

<h3>Grading Criteria</h3>
<p>The grading will be absolute, based on the following criteria</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tbody><tr><td>[85,100]</td><td>A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[80,85)</td><td>A-</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[75,80)</td><td>B</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[70-75)</td><td>B-</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[65-70)</td><td>C</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[60-65)</td><td>C-</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[50-60)</td><td>D</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[0-50)</td><td>F</td></tr>
    
</tbody></table>


<h3>Distribution of Marks</h3>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tbody><tr><td>Weekly Programming Assignments</td><td>25%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Surprise Quizzes</td><td>15%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Activity</td><td>10%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Attendance</td><td>05%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Minor</td><td>20%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Major</td><td>30%</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<h3>Problem Sets</h3>

<p>You are requested to note the following:</p>

<ul>

  
 <li>You must work <b>alone</b> on problem sets. You are <b>not allowed</b>
 to collaborate or discuss with anyone (including the course instructor 
and TA). The questions that will be posed to you will be self contained 
or will be a direct exercise problem from the text book. </li>
     <li>You should <b>not google</b> for a solution. The only companion
 to you during your solving of the given assignment will be the course 
text book, we suggest that you don't stay online when you are solving 
the exercise problems.</li>
     <li>Just in case we observe that you are copying from the internet (even partially) or collaborating with someone, you will get a <b>straight F grade</b>. </li>
         <li>You are not allowed to show your assignments to anyone, 
even if your friend sees your written script or discusses and borrows 
ideas from you and tries using the same method, we will regard that as <b>plagiarism</b>
 (straight F grade to both of you!). Even soliciting help for 
assignments is against the honor code, in case someone requests you, 
please report the name of that student to us and we will keep your 
identity anonymous and initiate action against him/her.</li>
     
<li> Problem sets will be posted every week and you will be given sufficient time to solve it. Submissions are accepted in <b>written format</b> only, on an A4 sized sheet which should be <u>punched and tagged and not pinned</u>. </li>
    <li>You must submit your assignment in the class sharpt at 0955 hrs every Monday. Late submissions of assignment will <b>fetch a 0</b>.
 In case you are unable to attempt a question, you should describe in 
detail your partial analysis /understanding/approach which, if observed 
to be good, can at times fetch you full marks. Take note that you are 
not allowed to submit your assignment before or after the above 
specified time, you may however submit it through a friend, just in case
 you are absent.
</li>
<li> The total number of problem sets isn't preset. We will normalize 
your marks and this will carry 15% of the overall course weightage.
    

</li><li> Minor and Major question paper should be considered as two 
additional problem sets and must be submitted before the deadline, which
 will be announced immediately after your exams. </li>

</ul>


<h3>Surprise Quiz</h3>

We will have a few surprise quiz sessions to test your understanding of 
the concepts taught in the previous classes. If you are attentive in the
 class, make notes and read them once before the class, you will do very
 well and will most certainly secure full marks. The number of quizzes 
isn't pre-decided, your marks will be normalized and will comprise of 
20% of the course weightage.

<h3>Activity</h3>
Activity will comprise of two parts:

<ul>

<li> Written assignment that is due by the first week of March.</li>
<li> Two Collaborating Learning Activities, one in the last week of January and the other one in the first week of March. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Attendance</h3>

Attendance for the course is compulsory. If you secure less than 75% 
attendance, you will be given an F grade, which is as per the institute 
rule. Attendance carries 0-5 marks, details of which is given in the 
table below:


<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tbody><tr><td>[95,100]</td><td>5</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[90,95)</td><td>4</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[85,90)</td><td>3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[80,85)</td><td>2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[75,80)</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[0,75)</td><td>F</td></tr>
    
</tbody></table>

I assume you all have undergone a course in real analysis and know what one means by a closed[]  and open interval() :-)

<h3>Minor and Major</h3>

<p>There will be two exams in the course, minor and major. The portions for major exam will be the entire syllabus.</p>

Minor will be of 2 hours duration and will comprise of 5 questions with 
three degrees of difficulty:  easy (1 quesiton), medium (2 questions) 
and hard (2 questions). Major will be of 3 hours duration and will 
comprise of 6 questions with three degrees of difficulty:  easy (2 
quesitons), medium (2 questions) and hard (2 questions). Degree of 
difficulty is a very subjective term which is left to the instructor to 
decide.

A student who has consistently practiced solving exercise problems from 
the text book and has solved all problem sets should be able to solve 
all the quesitons easily.




<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p> We are overly and overtly serious when it comes to academic 
integrity. We have 0 tolerance towards students who cheat. Action 
against those who cheat will involve not less than assigning them an F 
grade followed by immediate expulsion from the course. Over and above 
this, the case will be reported to the disciplinary committee which may 
decide to suspend the student for a semester or two. To repeat, <u>you 
must work alone on homework problems and not discuss them with anyone. 
The only materials you can refer when working on your problem sets are 
your course notes and the assigned text book. You may not refer to 
online sources or talk to others. When you are in doubt, ask the 
instructor or TA what is allowed and what isn't. Just in case you have 
overseen/suspect someone copying in the quiz/exam/problemsets, dutifully
 report it to us, we will scrutinize their scripts and will initiate 
action against them if they are found guilty. We assure that your 
identity wll be kept anonymous. We request that you report immediately 
(even if you are partially suspicious of any such malpractice amongst 
your classmates.)</u></p>
