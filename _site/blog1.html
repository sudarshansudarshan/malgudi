Having dwelled in the digital age, with documentaries and animations just a mouse click away, 
one has little to expect from an exhibition of science. I was of this opinion until I visited 
the sciencexpress at the central railway station in Chennai on August 12th 2012. The bio-diversity 
themed science exhibition on a train with 16 coaches didn’t take very long to prove me otherwise. 
The very first coach got me captivated, the interactive posters and multimedia exhibits kept old 
and the young equally engrossed. We were surrounded by young volunteers, who with bubbling energy 
were enlightening the crowd with woven facts, figures and anecdotes. The motive of the project 
seems to foster the awareness of our country’s biodiversity, inculcate the importance of knowing 
the climate change statistics, educate the public on the need to conserve water and energy; all 
of which was very well accomplished in a way that was fun-filled and delightful for the young 
and curious. As I walked past the last coach, I realised tacitly the delineating difference 
between an online video documentary and a live demonstration of this kind. While the former seems 
to be an inexpensive strategy to popularize sciences, the latter –if done well–undoubtedly has 
an impact ad valorem to the effort involved, both in terms of manpower and infrastructure.

The next phase of science express: quoting verbatim from the website sciencexpress.in: “It 
attempts to develop scientific temper among students and encourage them to pursue careers in 
science”. The primary motive of sciencexpress, as I understand, is to get the public’s foot 
into the door of science. To accomplish this, one needs to ensure that the content of the 
exhibition is motivational and that, it enkindles the inquisitiveness of our school goers. 
A content that is thematic, does little in this front as compared to a more generic exhibition 
comprising of basic science subjects such as physics, biology, mathematics, chemistry as 
themes. Given this top-of-the-line motive in mind, it wouldn’t harm to cycle the themes once 
in a few years.

As with the volunteers, one can invite dozens of them from the local schools/colleges. Such 
an initiative, apart from facilitating the breaking of the language barrier, would also 
popularize the sciencexpress through the local volunteers’ chain of acquaintances. One 
entire coach can be exclusively given to the local colleges/schools to display their models.

A drive such as sciencexpress if continued with the same dynamism as was witnessed at the 
Chennai railway station this year, would surely result in several apples hitting the heads 
of our country’s budding scientists.
