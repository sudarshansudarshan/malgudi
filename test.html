                <h1>Research</h1>
                
                <p>Distributed algorithms help agents work together to solve problems. My
                research studies these algorithms in <em>dynamic</em> network
                settings where attributes such as the participants and communication topology
                are unknown and perhaps even changing over time.
                These settings are increasingly relevant as networked computation becomes more
                ubiquitous. This reality opens a compelling opportunity
                to develop the theoretical foundations necessary to support reliable
                computation in an increasingly unreliable world.</p>

                Below is a sampling of my projects that study distributed algorithms in
                dynamic network models. (Last updated: Nov. 2014)</p>
                
                <p><b>A Theory of Shared Spectrum Networks</b></p>
                
                <p>
                We study upper and lower bounds for key communication
                problems in the <em>t-disrupted</em> model,
                which we introduced to abstract the key behavior of shared spectrum networks
                by providing devices access to multiple channels while also
                modeling unpredictable secondary use.

                <p>We study upper and lower bounds for key communication
                problems in the <em>dual graph</em> model,
                which we introduced to generalize standard radio network models
                to include unreliable links that behave unpredictably.

                I am currently funded by NSF CCF proposal number 1320279, "AF: Small:
                Algorithms for Wireless Networks with Dynamic Links,"
                as well by a Ford Motor Company University Research Program grant.
                I am the only academic PI on both grants.
