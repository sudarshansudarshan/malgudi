<p> The date wise topics that were covered are as follows:</p>
<p>
<h3> Lecture 01</h3>
<p>8th January,2014</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We saw the topics that will be covered in the course. Then, the lecture began with the discussion on "Classical ciphers". We saw what constitutes the crypto system. We dealt with Caesar Cipher, Substitution Cipher, Vigenere Cipher and lastly the Affine Cipher.
</p>
</p>
<p>
<h3> Lecture 02</h3>
<p>9th January,2014</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We saw Kerckhoffs's principle that showed how it was essential to never keep the encryption algorithm secret. The disadvantage of Affine cipher that leads to collisions and how to counter it. We also were introduced to "One time pad" for achieving perfect secrecy and also the use of L.F.S.R. We also had a brief introduction to the concept of Group through the classical example of a chemists lab that follows certain properties.
</p>
</p>
<p><h3> Lecture 03</h3>
<p>15th January,2014<br>8:00 AM to 10:00 AM</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We saw how our goal is to understand the concepts of "Finite fields" beginning from Group theory. We dealt with Division Algorithm. We were introduced to the concepts of Complete residue system. We also saw the fundamental theorem of Algebra, Calculus and Arithmetic. We also proved that the product of GCD and LCM of two numbers are in fact the product of the numbers themselves.
</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 04</h3>
<p>16th January,2014<br>8:00 AM to 10:00 AM</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We revisited the properties that the elements of a group must satisfy and saw a few examples of a group. We were also introduced to the concept Reduced residue system. We saw which subsets of <b> Z </b> form a group under addition. We also dealt with seeing if <b> Zn*</b> is a group under multiplication. We also defined Euler's totient function and saw Willson's theorem. We also saw the identity that 'n' is prime if and only if n|(n+1)!+1.
</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 05</h3>
<p>21st January,2014<br>11:00 AM to 1:00 PM</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We saw yet another interesting example of a group where different configurations of a triangle lead to the formation of a group.We saw what C(k,n) is and whether it forms a subgroup of <b>Zn</b>. We were introduced to the concept of Cyclic groups. We were finally presented with the problem where we were asked to state what we could conclude about the cyclic nature of <b> Zn*</b>. 
</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 06</h3>
<p>22nd January,2014<br>8:00 AM to 10:00 AM</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We were formally introduced to the notion of a subgroup. We then took a random walk to explore the concept of subgroups and proved Lagrange's theorem by making a few observations. We also saw the Prime number theorem. We proved Euler's theorem and Fermat's Little theorem.
</p></p>

</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 07</h3>
<p>23nd January,2014<br>8:00 AM to 10:00 AM</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We took a look at Euclid's algorithm that returns the GCD of given two numbers. We also looked at the proof of correctness of the algorithm as well as its time complexity, with examples. We also discussed the theorem that states that the GCD of given two numbers can be expressed as the linear combination of the numbers themselves and saw the proof of it as well. We were also introduced to the Chinese Reminder theorem, the proof of which will be taken up in the next lecture.
</p></p>


</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 08</h3>
<p>28th January,2014<br>11:00 AM to 1:00 PM</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We had already had an introduction to Chinese Reminder theorem, hence we continued with the proof which involved seeing if a solution exists or not. We also saw the different form of Chinese theorem which gave a mapping f : Zpq --> Zp X Zq where f(x)=(x%p,x%q). We also saw how the phi(mn)=phi(m).phi(n)
<p>We also saw the concept of Diffie Hellman key exchange and the need for a digital locking mechanism that ensures authenticity and authorization.
 </p>
</p></p>


</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 09</h3>
<p>29th January,2014<br>8:00 AM to 10:00 AM</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We began with the RSA algorithm for the realization of the most needed secure cryptosystem. We also saw the two variations of a secure system; one that is computationally secure and that which is perfectly secure. We also had an introduction to Zero knowledge proofs.
</p></p>


</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 10</h3>
<p>6th February,2014<br>8:00 AM to 10:00 AM</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We saw the contributions of Shafi Goldwasser. We saw the ease of constructing a 3-colourable graph in contrast to the challenging task of finding if a given graph is 3-colourable. Using this idea, we saw how one could convince the third person of the existence of the knowledge without the third person gaining any knowledge himself. We also saw what randomness meant and quite a handful of ways to generate random numbers.
</p></p>

<p></p>
<p>
Maximum Marks: 130
</p>
<p>Test Duration: 4 Hours</p>

</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 11</h3>
<p>18th February,2014<br>11:00 AM to 1:00 PM</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We revisited the concept of cyclic groups and saw what a generator was. We took up a few examples to <b>Zn*</b> and tried to make a few observations to see when it is a cyclic group. We also saw that when <b>Zn*</b> is cyclic, the set generated by its element is also a subgroup.We also saw the proof to theorem that states that the sum of phi(d), where d is all the possible divisors of N, adds up to N.We also saw the idea behind Diffie Hellman key exchange.
</p></p>


</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 12</h3>
<p>25th February,2014<br>11:00 AM to 1:00 PM</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We saw about how there exists a band of numbers that are prime close to the value of root n. We took examples to study the case of Zn* being cyclic. We saw the following:<br>1. In zp*,if a belongs to Zp* then O(a)|p-1<br>2.Sum of Phi(d) for all divisors 'd' of n, adds up to n<br>3. x to the power of alpha has at most alpha roots in Zp*.<br>4. Any cyclic group of cardinality n has precisely phi(n) generators.<br> Thus we saw that Zp* is cyclic.
</p></p>




</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 13</h3>
<p>4th March,2014<br>11:00 AM to 1:00 PM</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
Our motive for the class was to understand three crypto systems. We saw what Massey-Omura(three pass protocol) dealt with and saw how one could realize it. We saw in brief how session key is exchanged between the client and the server using ssh. We also saw what Diffie Hellman key exchange was and saw how we could realize it. In the process we saw why it was important to take a cyclic group and the role of the generator and the ease with which one could find the generators of the group. This was how we also realized the discrete log problem.
</p></p>


</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 14</h3>
<p>5th March,2014
<br>6:30 PM to 8:00 PM [1.5 Hours]</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We saw how we could take advantage of the discrete log problem to develop a secure cryptosystem. This was ElGamal encryption. We also saw how to provide a zero knowledge proof using the discrete log problem. We also briefly discussed about how the ElGamal encryption system could reveal information if used for zero knowledge proof.
</p></p>


</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 15</h3>
<p>6th March,2014
<br>6:00 PM to 7:30 PM [1.5 Hours]</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
The motive was to learn about Finite Fields. So, we began by seeing how <b>Z</b> was additive group. We also saw the proof for one multiplied by zero is zero [1 * 0 = 0] and also how negative one times negative one is one [-1 * -1 = 1]. WE saw what rings were and saw a few examples. We saw what it meant to say <b>G/H</b> where <b>G</b> is a group and <b>H</b> being its subgroup and also saw how it turned out to be a group in itself. We saw what Ideals were and saw how every ideal of ring <b>Z</b> must be of the form k<b>Z</b>. and finally we saw what a field was.
</p></p>

</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 16</h3>
<p>7th March,2014
<br>10:00 AM to 11:30 AM [1.5 Hours]</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We began by considering all the ideals of ring <b>Z</b> and saw how they are always of the form <b>nZ</b> and questioned if there is any ideal such that <b>nZ</b> subset of some ideal <b>I</b> which is the subset of <b>Z</b>. We also wondered as to what happens if the 'n' is prime. Then we concluded that this would lead to a what is called a maximal ideal. We saw the celebrated result that a ring R that has a maximal ideal M, then R/M is a "Field". 
</p></p>


</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 17</h3>
<p>11th March,2014
<br>11:00 AM to 1:00 PM [2 Hours]</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We were introduced to the concept of Steganography. We also tried to answer if there were any other finite fields, other than <b>Zp</b>. We saw <b>Z</b> was a ring and that <b>Z/6Z</b> was also a ring. We saw other examples of rings and ideals like polynomial ring and discussed the structure of it.
</p></p>


</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 18</h3>
<p>12th March,2014
<br>8:00 AM to 10:00 AM [2 Hours]</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We started by revising a few concepts about rings, ideals, quotient rings. We saw what one meant by zero divisors.Then we saw the proof of how a finite ring without zero divisors is a field and the proof of how <b>R/M</b> is a field.
</p></p>



</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 19</h3>
<p>13th March,2014
<br>8:00 AM to 10:00 AM [2 Hours]</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
We revisited the proof for "Quotient ring formed using maximal ideal is a field". Briefly discussed Shannon's theory of perfect secrecy. Studied the crypto-system DES (Data Encryption Standard) in detail. We also discussed "Avalanche effect", which is present in DES.
</p></p>



</p></p>
<p><h3> Lecture 20</h3>
<p>18th March,2014
<br>11:00 AM to 1:00 PM [2 Hours]</br></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
Our motive was to understand Stream ciphers. We saw how one time pad could be possible if there was a way to generate long length keys starting from a small seed. We saw how LFSRs could be used to realize this. We also saw the 5 tests to use when we need to negate if a sequence is not random. We also proved how a fields cannot have a proper ideal. We were also given a reading assignment to understand clearly what a field F is, how is F* cyclic, how to generate primitive polynomial and an irreducible polynomial. We also had a brief overview of random number generation using RSA and Blum-Blum-Shub(B.B.S)

<p></p>
<p>
We were exposed to the AES algorithm and we saw the difference between symmetric keys and asymmetric keys. We also saw the different modes of operation that can be used. One example we saw was the CBC (Cipher block chaining) mode and we saw how error propagates and effects the encrypted message.
